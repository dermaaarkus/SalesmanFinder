The project was build with Xcode 15 for iOS 17 and later. It was a fun and nice task to work on ðŸ¥³

# Documentation

## Comments
I left some `// TODO:` and `// NOTE` comments in the code to make it easier for the reviewer of my submitted challenge.

## Code Coverage
The code coverage is about 98% in the final state of my work. Aiming for 100% doesn't make sense in my opinion and leads to write complex and/or not necessary unit test. On the other hand also a high code converage does not necessarily cover all edge cases, e.g. iterating on arrays with zero value, one value, many values.

## Other
I did not use the optional framework `Realm`, because I like to keep it simple and easy to understand for only one scene in the app.
